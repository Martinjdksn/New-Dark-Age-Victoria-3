nda_authors.10.d:0 "News has reach us of a holy man in Averoigne doing great works among the faithful.\n\n[SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_azedarac').GetFullName], the recently appointed Bishop of Ximes appears to be destined for great things!\n\nSome say he is the reincarnation of St. Azédarac the renowned 12th Century saint, not that we believe in that sort of heresy."
nda_authors.10.f:0 "'St. Azédarac died and was duly canonized in 1198. Some say that he did not die, but was transported to heaven alive, and that his body was never buried in the great mausoleum reared for him at Ximes. But that is probably a mere legend.'"

nda_authors.20.t:0 "The White Worm?"
nda_authors.20.d:0 "A tragic tale from the Midlands of England has reached our ears.\n\nIt appears that the last of an ancient line of nobles, Edgar Caswall, Master of Castra Regis, has lost their life due to their delving into the art of Mesmerism, and the resulting actions of a local Lady, Arabella of Diana's Grove. She was said to be possesed by the spirit of a snake.\n\n A lightining strike is presumed to have killed the Lady after hitting the gunpowder store where she was hiding after brutally slaying Caswell."
nda_authors.20.f:0 "'...have come to the conclusion that the foul White Worm obtained control of her body, just as her soul was leaving its earthly tenement -- that would explain the sudden revival of energy, the strange and inexplicable craving for maiming and killing, as well as many other matters with which I need not trouble you now...\n\n ...God alone knows what poor Captain March discovered -- it must have been something too ghastly for human endurance, if my theory is correct that the once beautiful human body of Lady Arabella is under the control of this ghastly White Worm.'"
nda_authors.20.a:0 "They might have survived..."
nda_authors.20.b:0 "but it is unlikely."

nda_authors.30.f:0 "'...is a very angry person. But I don't know much about them otherwise, except that they are a person of wealth, and they're an alchemist, apparently, and wants to tell us all about it; and that's about all — except that I don't want to meet them for the next week or two.'"

nda_authors.31.f:0 "'...and he suddenly begins to run like mad, loses his hat and stick, and finally shins up a tree\n\n...found next morning with the most dreadful face of fear on him that could be imagined.\n\n...was in a very odd state, undeniably, from time to time, during some weeks before, though not immediately before, the catastrophe. There were several things; the principal notion he had was that he thought he was being followed.\n\nNo doubt he was an impressionable man, but he never had had such fancies as this before...'"

nda_authors.32.t:0 "A Concerned Intellectual"
nda_authors.32.d:0 "The prominent intellectual, [SCOPE.sCharacter('nda_rune_potential_victim').GetFullName], has come forward with concerns that they too are being harrased and followed by the Cultist, [SCOPE.sCharacter('nda_rune_antagonist').GetFullName].\n\nThey describe how they were covertly given a leaflet by the Cultist and how, inside, it contained a slip of paper with strange runic symbols upon it.\n\nThey are unsure what their next course of action should be."
nda_authors.32.f:0 "'...the characters on it were more like Runes than anything else, but not decipherable by either person, and both hesitated to copy them, for fear, as they confessed, of perpetuating whatever evil purpose they might conceal.\n\nSo it has remained impossible to ascertain what was conveyed in this curious message or commission.'"
