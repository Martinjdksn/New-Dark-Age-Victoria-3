The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and termination of the disease, were the incidents of half an hour.'"

His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. There are some who would have thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not. It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not...\n\nAnd one by one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing posture of his fall...\n\nAnd Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.'"
