nda_hgw.10.d:0 "Astronomers are reporting a strange object in the depths of the outer solar system.\n\nIt appears to be large enough to disturb the very paths of the planets."
nda_hgw.10.f:0 "'It was on the first day of the new year that the announcement was made, almost simultaneously from three observatories, that the motion of the planet Neptune, the outermost of all the planets that wheeled about the sun, had become erratic. Such a piece of news was scarcely calculated to interest the world the greater portion of whose inhabitants were unaware of the existence of the planet Neptune, nor outside the astronomical profession did the subsequent discovery of a faint remote speck of light in the region of the perturbed planet cause any great excitement.\n\nScientific people, however, found the intelligence remarkable enough, even before it became known that the new body was rapidly growing larger and brighter, that its motion was quite different from the orderly progress of the planets, and that the deflection of Neptune and its satellite was becoming now of an unprecedented kind.'"

nda_hgw.11.t:0 "A New Star"
nda_hgw.11.d:0 "The object is now clearly visible in the sky, both during night and day.\n\nIt appears to be rapidly moving on a course towards the Earth, getting larger with each passing day!"
nda_hgw.11.f:0 "'The star grew — it grew with a terrible steadiness hour after hour, a little larger each hour, a little nearer the midnight zenith, and brighter and brighter, until it had turned night into day.\n\nHad it come straight to the earth instead of in a curved path, had it lost no velocity to Jupiter, it must have leapt the intervening gulf in a day; but as it was it took five days altogether to come by our planet.\n\nThe next night it had become a third the size of the moon before it set to English eyes, and the thaw was assured.'"
nda_hgw.11.a:0 "What to do?"

nda_hgw.12.t:0 "Disaster!"
nda_hgw.12.d:0 "The 'Star' as it is being called has passed close to Earth but has wrought devestation in its passing\n\nThe point of closest approach has been scorched barren. The tides caused spawning devestating Tsunamis around the globe."
nda_hgw.12.f:0 "'...the storms drove the waters in many cases scores of miles inland, drowning whole cities. And so great grew the heat during the night that the rising of the sun was like the coming of a shadow.\n\n...jungles were aflame in a thousand places, and below the hurrying waters around the stems were dark objects that struggled feebly and reflected the blood red tongues of fire. And in a ungovernable confusion a multitude of men and women fled down the broad riverways to that one last hope of men—the open sea.\n\nLarger grew the star, and larger, hotter, and brighter with a terrible swiftness now. The tropical ocean had lost its phosphorescence, and the whirling steam rose in ghostly wreaths from the black waves that plunged incessantly, speckled with storm-tossed ships.'"
nda_hgw.12.a:0 "Disaster!"

nda_hgw.13.t:0 "A Near Escape"
nda_hgw.13.d:0 "The World must now pick up the pieces in the aftermath of this apocalyptic calamity.\n\nWho is capable of rebuilding society?\nWhat does the future hold?"
nda_hgw.13.f:0 "'The Martian astronomers — for there are astronomers on Mars, although they are different beings from men — were naturally profoundly interested by these things.\n\nThey saw them from their own standpoint, of course...\n\n“Considering the mass and temperature of the missile that was flung through our solar system into the sun,” one wrote, “it is astonishing what little damage the earth, which it missed so narrowly, has sustained. All the familiar continental markings and the masses of the seas remain intact, and indeed the only difference seems to be a shrinkage of the white discoloration (supposed to be frozen water) round either pole.”\n\nWhich only shows how small the vastest of human catastrophies may seem at a distance of a few million miles.'"
